# 🚀 Git Workflow & Contribution Guidelines

This document defines the branching strategy, roles, and workflow to ensure smooth collaboration and stable deployments.

## 🌳 Branch Architecture

### Core Branches

- **`main`**
  - Production branch
  - Used strictly for deployment/hosting
  - 🔒 Direct commits and PRs are NOT allowed

- **`QA`**
  - Integration and testing branch
  - All development work must be merged here first

---

## 🔁 Development Workflow

1. Create your personal branch from `QA`
2. Work on your feature/fix
3. Push your branch to the repository
4. Raise a Pull Request (**PR**) → target: `QA`
5. Get your code reviewed
6. PR gets merged into `QA` after approval
7. Selected members will later merge `QA` → `main` for deployment

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

- ❌ No PRs to `main`
- ✅ All PRs must target `QA`
- ✅ Always pull latest `QA` before starting new work
- ✅ Keep PRs small and focused
